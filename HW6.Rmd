5.) 
Some PO Box addresses still appear in the "Dont"" data frame. Should change what we are filtering by.

##Back to the Streets

```{r}
pattern <- "(ST|RD|ROAD)" #assigns the regex expression (which is a substring that will include all entries with ST, RD, or ROAD) to pattern to it can easily called later
LeftOvers <-    #names new data frame 
  Addresses %>% #pipes data table Adresses into next function
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address),
          ! grepl(" APT|UNIT [[:digit:]]+$", address)) #filters out any entry with the previously assigned pattern (entries with ST, RD, or ROAD) and also filters out any entry with APT or UNIT and one or more numbers following at the end.

head(LeftOvers) #i use head() function for the sake of the knitted html so the table isnt too long
```
```{r}
Sample <- Addresses %>%
  sample_n(size = 200) 

```


```{r}

pattern <- "(ST|STREET|RD|ROAD|COURT|DR|DRIVE|AVE|TRAIL|LN|LANE|HOSPITAL|PL|PLACE|PKWY|BOX|B0X|BX|CIRCLE|CIR|CT|WAY|HALL|WOODS|TR|MANOR|TERRACE|COVE|BLVD|NCSU|HWY|NEUS|RIDGE)"  #i kept adding street endings I saw while filtering out. My regex for the endings


LeftOvers <- Sample %>% #pipe in my sample of the addresses data frame
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address),
          ! grepl(" APT|UNIT [[:digit:]]+$", address)) #filter out patterns i saw in order to find new ones. 

LeftOvers #calling table with only the leftover street endings to identify more street endings


Match<- Sample %>% # piping in my sample table of addresses
  extractMatches(pattern, address) # extracts all the parts of each address in each row that match my regex named pattern. This is stored as a new variable (a new column) in my Match table

head(Match) #call table to verify previous code worked


Count <- transform(Match, count = table(match1)[match1]) #adds new variable that counts how many of a specific entry there are in the whole data table. This way I can see how many times a street ending pattern appeared in my sample

Count <- Count %>% #pipes Count table 
  mutate(ending = match1, count = count.Freq) %>% #I renamed previous variables of match1 and count.Freq to ending and count respectively to easier examine the table
  select(ending, count) %>% #keep only the variables ending and count in my table
  unique() #makes each case unique, this way there are no repeats throughout the table and we can more easily examine the data

Count #call final table that shows count of each street ending


```

I filtered out the street name endings i knew existed, and kept filtering for those as well as adding endings that I saw appear. Everytime I filtered out more, I saw endings I hadn't seen before that I could filter for and examine. Then I created a new table that displays the street endings I found as well as how many there were of each type in my sample. 

Below I use my method above on the whole data set Addresses the best I could. 

```{r}
pattern1 <- "(ST|STREET|RD|ROAD|COURT|DR|DRIVE|AVE|TRAIL|LN|LANE|HOSPITAL|PL|PLACE|PKWY|BOX|B0X|BX|CIRCLE|CIR|CT|WAY|HALL|WOODS|TR|MANOR|TERRACE|COVE|BLVD|NCSU|HWY|NEUS(E)|RIDGE|CENTER|SQUARE|PARKWAY|VALLEY|VILLAGE|FARM|PATH|UNIVERSITY|HOUSE|HILLS|RUN|COLLEGE|HOME|LOOP|POINT|WYND|PT|PASS)"  #i kept adding street endings I saw while filtering out. My regex for the endings


LeftOvers1 <- Addresses %>% #pipe in whole data set Addresses
  filter( ! grepl(pattern1, address),
          ! grepl(" APT|UNIT [[:digit:]]+$", address)) #filter out patterns i saw in order to find new ones. 

head(LeftOvers1) #calling table with only the leftover street endings to identify more street endings


Match1<- Addresses %>% # piping in Addresses
  extractMatches(pattern1, address) # extracts all the parts of each address in each row that match my regex named pattern. This is stored as a new variable (a new column) in my Match table

head(Match1) #call table to verify previous code worked


Count1 <- transform(Match1, count = table(match1)[match1]) #adds new variable that counts how many of a specific entry there are in the whole data table. This way I can see how many times a street ending pattern appeared in Addresses data set

Count1 <- Count1 %>% #pipes Count table 
  mutate(ending = match1, count = count.Freq) %>% #I renamed previous variables of match1 and count.Freq to ending and count respectively to easier examine the table
  select(ending, count) %>% #keep only the variables ending and count in my table
  unique() #makes each case unique, this way there are no repeats throughout the table and we can more easily examine the data

Count1 #call final table that shows count of each street ending

```
